# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```command prompt
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run --network hardhat scripts/deploy.js
npx hardhat run --network hardhat scripts/Whitelister.js
```
